# WDPG

WordNet in PostgreSQL.

This is an (admittedly sloppy) set of scripts to download, parse and dump the
[WordNet][wordnet] data into PostgreSQL.

[wordnet]: https://wordnet.princeton.edu

## Usage

```
make DATABASE=wdpg
```

`DATABASE` can specify a local PostgreSQL database or a connection URL.

Ruby is required. An alternate Ruby path can be specified with the make
variable `RUBY`.

## Structure

WDPG creates the following types:

- `pos` (part of speech)
- `pointer_symbol`
- `syntactic_marker`

WDPG creates the following tables:

- `pos_labels`
- `pointer_symbol_labels`
- `syntactic_marker_labels`
- `lemmas`
- `lemma_synsets`
- `synsets`
- `words`
- `synset_synsets`
- `word_words`
